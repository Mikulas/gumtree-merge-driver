# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes/2.11.1#_defining_a_custom_merge_driver

# The merge.*.driver variable’s value is used to construct
# a command to run to merge ancestor’s version (%O),
# current version (%A) and the other branches' version (%B).
# These three tokens are replaced with the names of temporary
# files that hold the contents of these versions when the
# command line is built. Additionally, %L will be replaced
# with the conflict marker size (see below).
# The merge driver is expected to leave the result of the
# merge in the file named with %A by overwriting it, and exit
# with zero status if it managed to merge them cleanly,
# or non-zero if there were conflicts.
# The merge driver can learn the pathname in which the merged
# result will be stored via placeholder %P.

	driver = $0 %O %A %B \"path-to-gumtree\"
	recursive = binary

## .gitattributes
